# Hi, I'm Favour Edet 👋 

## Analytics Engineering & Data Warehousing
I am a Data Professional transitioning from an Agricultural Science background into **Analytics Engineering** and **Data Warehousing**. I specialize in building scalable cloud environments and transforming complex datasets into reliable, clean models that drive business strategy.
​Currently a student at the University of Uyo, I bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights by combining my **IBM Data Analyst certification** with a deep specialization in the **Modern Data Stack**, including **Snowflake, dbt, and Git**. I am passionate about data modeling (Star Schema), version control, and building the infrastructure that makes data-driven decision-making possible.
​
### Core Technical Expertise:
- **​Data Transformation**: Advanced SQL (CTEs, Window Functions) & dbt modeling.
- **​Cloud Warehousing**: Snowflake architecture, Snowpipe, and storage optimization.
- **​Version Control**: Git/GitHub for collaborative, production-ready development.
- **​Insight Generation**: Statistical analysis and KPI reporting.


### 🚀 Featured Projects
- **[E-Commerce Analytics Pipeline](https://github.com/FavourEdet-Data/BRAZIL_ESTORE_DBT):** Built a full-scale Snowflake + dbt project involving staging, intermediate, and mart layers with automated data quality tests.
- **[Foodhub ETL Workflow](https://github.com/FavourEdet-Data/snowflake_foodhub_project.sql):** Developed a Python and SQL-based workflow to clean and load food delivery data into a structured warehouse.
